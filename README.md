## Tasks  
1. Develop a geometric shapes class hierarchy - Circle, Triangle, Square, Rectangle, etc...  Classes should describe the properties of a shape and have methods for calculating the area and perimeter of the shape. (*A task with an emphasis on building an inheritance hierarchy, without unduly detailed implementation*).
2. Create a class hierarchy and implement key methods for a computer game (no functional requirements yet). Game's plot:
- A player can move within a rectangular field with size Width * Height
- There are some bonuses on the fiels (apples, cherries, bananas) which could be picked up by a player and give them score points
- There are some monsters (wolves, bears) hunting the player and move using an algoritm
- There are some obstacles on the field (stones, trees) which player and monster should avoid
- The goal is to collect all bonuses and don't be eaten by monsters

Note: it's possible to use abstract classes and interfaces
